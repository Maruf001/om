# OM: Online Data Analysis for X-Ray Imaging

## What is OM?

**OM** (**O**nDA **M**onitor) is a software tool for the the **development** of
programs that can monitor X-ray imaging experiments in **real-time**. It is also a set
of ready-to-use **monitoring programs**.

It is the spiritual successor of the **OnDA** project and it is maintained mostly by
the same team of developers.

OM provides users with a set of stable and efficient real-time monitors for the most
common types of x-ray imaging experiments. These **can be used immediately** without
modifications or **can be easily adapted** to meet the usersâ€™ requirements. In
addition, the project provides a set of modules that can be used to **easily develop**
other monitoring programs, tailored to the characteristics of specific experiments.

OM can process imaging data in the broadest sense: multidimensional and
multiple-pixel data (for example, a diffraction pattern or a photoemission spectrum,
but also an image coming from a camera or a microscope), and any kind of digital output
from an instrument or sensor (for example, a temperature readout, beam and pulse
energies, etc.).

OM focuses on **scalability and portability**, in order to facilitate its adoption
for a wide array of current and future instruments. It also strives for
**stability and performance**. In order to achieve these goals, OM implements a
multi-node parallelization paradigm using free and open-source libraries and protocols.

OM is written in Python. The use of the Python programming language, which is
particularly suited to prototyping and rapid development, makes OM easy to modify and
to adapt to the requirements of specific experiments.

OM also aims to keep the code base **simple and as small as possible**. The focus is
on providing a core set of functions, while allowing the framework to be expanded with
external software when possible, avoiding the need to reimplement already optimized
algorithms.
